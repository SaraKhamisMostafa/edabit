'''
There is a single operator in Python, capable of providing the remainder of
a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters.
The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder,
possibly zero. Return that value.

Examples
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0

remainder(7, 2) ➞ 1
Notes
The tests only use positive integers.
Don't forget to return the result.
If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
